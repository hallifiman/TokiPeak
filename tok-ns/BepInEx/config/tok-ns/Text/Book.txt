PREFACE=OPEN
##	Ahh....................................................................................................................................................................... nature.\n\n	What greater ecstacy in this life than crunching down on a succulent granola bar while the wind blows across your scalp atop one of this world's many miraculous mountaintops?\n\n	But of course, nature is not just some fairground amusement, some attraction we might enjoy leisurely from behind glass! Indeed, nature is as dangerous as it is beautiful. And the view is much better from 10,000 feet up than 6 feet under! (Dead)\n\nIn my 40 years as a Scoutmaster, I've accumulated a variety of rules for surviving dangerous wilderness situations that should help you out in the unlikely event one of your scout outings goes horribly wrong. But of course, all of these rules pale in comparison to the guiding rule of all scoutdom...##
r:"^(.+)Ahh...........(.+)$"=\t啊.................................................大自然。\n\n\t在這個世界上，有什麼比在奇妙的山頂上，風吹過你的頭皮時，咬一口多汁的穀物棒更令人陶醉的呢？\n\n\t但當然，大自然不僅僅是遊樂場的娛樂設施，不是我們隔著玻璃悠閒欣賞的景點！的確，大自然既美麗又危險。從10,000英尺高處的景色遠比6英尺深的地下好看！（XoX）\n\n\t在我40年的童軍領袖生涯中，我積累了許多在危險荒野中生存的規則，這些規則應該能幫助你應對童軍活動不幸出錯的罕見情況。但當然，這些規則與童軍的最高準則相比都顯得微不足道...

RULE 0\n=規則 0\n
NEVER ABANDON A FRIEND IN NEED!=永遠不要放棄需要幫助的朋友！
-Scoutmaster Myres=-童軍領袖邁爾斯

RULE 1=規則 1
KEEP MOVING!=<size\=45\>繼續前進！</size>

	First things first: you've gotta get to HIGH GROUND if you wanna be spotted. Nobody ever got rescued off of a mysterious island by loitering around on the beach. So find the nearest peak, and start making your way there.=	首要任務：如果你想被發現，就必須到達高地。沒有人會因為在海灘上閒逛而從神秘島嶼上獲救。所以找到最近的山峰，開始朝那裡前進。
r:"^(.+)LOOK AROUND$"=$1環顧四周
r:"^(.+)WALK$"=$1行走

	Time is of the essence in the wilderness, so get running towards your destination!=	一寸光陰一寸金，把握時間趕快到達目的地！
r:"^(.+)SPRINT$"=$1衝刺

	See a gap in the trail, or a prickly thorn? Go ahead and JUMP over it!=	看到小路上的小坑，或者刺人的荊棘？直接跳過去吧！

	Keep in mind that jumping while sprinting will tire you out quickly! Take a quick rest if you need to - you won't do anyone any favors by passing out on the mountain!=	請記住，衝刺時跳躍會很快讓你筋疲力盡！找個安全位置稍作休息吧。畢竟...在路上昏倒對誰都沒好處！

RULE 2=規則 2
KEEP MOVING (UP)! =<size\=45>繼續向上前進！</size>

	Obviously, you're not going to make it up a mountain without climbing.=\t顯然，你無法不透過攀爬登上山頂。

	You can climb almost any surface, so long as you have the stamina!=\t只要你有足夠的體力，幾乎任何表面都能爬走！

r:"^HOLD(.+)EMPTY-HANDED: GRAB WALL$"=空手時長按<size\=80%>$1</size>抓住牆壁
r:"^(.+)IN AIR: GRAB WALL$"=在攀爬時按下$1來跳高
r:"^(.+)WHILE CLIMBING: LUNGE$"=攀爬時按下$1來衝刺

RULE 3=規則 3
ALWAYS LEND A HAND!=<size\=45>總是向朋友伸出援手！</size>

	Nothing is more important than sticking together as a team!=\t沒有什麼比團隊團結更重要！

	When your hands are empty, reach out to a friend who's mid-climb and help them reach the next ledge safely!=\t當你的雙手空著時，伸手幫助正在攀爬的朋友，讓他們安全到達下一個落腳點！

r:"^(.+) EMPTY-HANDED: HELP UP FRIEND$"=<size\=85%\>空手時按下$1來幫助朋友更容易爬上來</size>

	You can help from below, too! Crouch down and let a fellow scout stand on your head, then jump to give them a boost!=你也可以從下方幫忙！蹲下來讓另一位童軍站在你頭上，然後跳起幫助他爬得更高！

RULE 4=規則 4
STAY ALERT, STAY ALIVE!=<size\=45>保持警覺活下去！</size>
##	An effective scout keeps an eye on their <color\=#0f7f00>Stamina Bar</color> at all times. If it runs out, you'll be temporarily unable to run, jump, and most importantly, climb. \n\n	Worst case scenario, you could fall off the mountain to your death, which is the worst thing to fall off to!##
r:"^	An effective scout keeps an eye on their(.+)$"=\t一位歷練的童軍會時刻注意他們的<color\=#0f7f00>體力條</color>。如果體力耗盡，你將暫時無法跑步、跳躍，最重要的是無法攀爬。\n\n\t最壞的是從山上墜落致死——最糟糕的墜落方式！

RULE 5=規則 5
LIFE IS PAIN!=<size\=45>生活即痛苦！</size>
##	As you make your way through the untamed wilderness, it's inevitable that you'll get some scratches and bumps. \n\n	The more hurt you get, the less <color\=#0f7f00>Stamina</color> you'll have to run and climb, so tend to your injuries as soon as possible with a bandage or a healing herb!##
r:"^	As you make your way through the untamed wilderness(.+)$"=\t在未開發的荒野中前行，難免會有些擦傷和碰撞。\n\n\t受傷越重，能用於跑步和攀爬的<color\=#0f7f00>體力</color>就越少，因此要盡快用繃帶或藥草處理傷口！

RULE 6=規則 6
STAY HUNGRY=<size\=50>保持飢餓</size>\n
 \n<size\=30>(ACTUALLY, DON'T!)= \n<size\=25>\n(不要真的做呀！)
##	Getting hurt isn't the only way for your <color\=#0f7f00>Stamina</color> to go downhill fast. As you climb, you'll find yourself experiencing <color\=#b58200>Hunger</color>, for which 10/10 experts recommend eating food.\n\n	Be cautious of eating plants from the wilderness! They could poison you and really mess up your day. If you have the option, choose a packaged snack from a corporation you trust!##
r:"^	Getting hurt isn't the only way for your(.+)$"=\t受傷不是讓你的<color\=#0f7f00>體力</color>迅速下降的唯一方式。在攀爬時，你會感到<color\=#b58200>飢餓</color>，10位專家中有10位建議吃食物。\n\n\t小心食用野外的植物！它們可能有毒，會嚴重影響你的一天。如果有選擇，挑選你信任的企業生產的包裝零食！

RULE 7=規則 7
DON'T OVERPACK!=<size\=45>不要超載！</size>
##	Putting a backpack on is a great way to carry additional items, which can make the difference between life and death!\n\n	HOWEVER, the more <color\=#61380a>Weight</color> you carry, the less stamina you'll have to climb! An experienced scout knows to pack everything they need... and nothing more!##
r:"^	Putting a backpack on is a great way to carry additional items, which can make the difference between life and death!(.+)$"=\t背上背包是攜帶更多道具的好方法，這可能攸關生死！\n\n\t然而，你攜帶的<color\=#61380a>重量</color>越多，能用於攀爬的體力就越少！經驗豐富的童軍知道帶上所有必需品……不多不少！

RULE 8=規則 8
KEEP AN EYE OUT!=<size\=45>保持警惕！</size>
##	In a survival situation, one of the worst things that can happen is getting separated from the group. \n\n	Maintain constant communication whenever possible, and point out your next route in advance to avoid leaving a friend behind!##
r:"^	In a survival situation, one of the worst things that can happen is getting separated from the group.(.+)$"=\t在生存情境中，最糟糕的事情之一就是與團隊失散。\n\n\t盡可能保持持續聯繫，並提前標記你的下一條路線，以免落下朋友！
r:"^(.+):PING LOCATION$"=按下$1來標記位置

IN CONCLUSION=<size\=45>結論</size>
##	Exploring the wilderness is a dangerous activity that can kill you instantly - but so is everything in this world worth doing, like falling in love.\n\nNever forget to be a good steward towards our beautiful world, and once again, never forget:##
r:"^	Exploring the wilderness is a dangerous activity that can kill you instantly - but so is everything in this world worth doing, like falling in love.(.+)$"=\t探索荒野是一項危險的活動，可能瞬間致命——但這個世界上值得做的事情都是如此，比如墜入愛河。\n\n\t永遠不要忘記做我們美麗世界的良好管家，再次提醒，永遠不要忘記：

Dear Diary, bad news!!!\n\n	The ship captain made an oopsy, and we've wound up crashed on this mysterious island! Thankfully, mysterious islands are my specialty.\n\n	With our whole troop working together, we'll reach the top of the PEAK and signal for help in no time!\n\n	In the meantime, I'll take this opportunity to add some additional pages to my famous guidebook.\n\n	<align\=right>-Scoutmaster Myres\n=親愛的日記，壞消息！！！\n\n	船長出了個大錯，我們撞上了這個神秘島嶼！幸好，我相當熟悉如何在神秘島嶼存活下去。\n\n	只要我們整個團隊齊心協力，我們很快就能到達頂峰並發出求救信號！\n\n	與此同時，我將趁此機會為我的著名指南書添加一些額外頁面。\n\n	<align\=right>-童軍領袖邁爾斯\n

##	Wuh woh! One of our scouts stepped on a sea urchin and died!!! I was about to get really sad... but one of the other kids touched a weird statue, and brought their friend back to life! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n	Seems like this island bends the rules of mortality itself... how wacky! Perhaps something else interesting might happen if we use a statue when everyone is still alive...##
r:"^(.+)Wuh woh! One of our scouts stepped on a sea urchin and died!!!(.+)$"=\t<size\=150%\>哇哦！我們的一個朋友踩到海膽死了！本來我都要難過死了……但另一個夥伴摸了那座奇怪的雕像，就把朋友復活了！\n\n\n\n\n\n\n看來這座島打破了死亡的規則……真瘋狂！或許當大家都還活著時，再摸一下那個雕像會發生更有趣的事情……</size>

HUDDLE UP!=<size\=85%\>擠在一起！
##	As we approach the PEAK, the temperature has begun dropping dramatically. Seeking constant cover is a must, and getting caught out in the open when the wind is strong can be a death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	If all else fails, huddling with your friends to share body heat might just save you from an icy grave.##
r:"^(.+)As we approach the PEAK, the temperature has begun dropping dramatically.(.+)$"=<size\=150%\>\t隨著我們靠近頂峰，氣溫開始急劇下降。必須隨時找掩護，強風中暴露在空曠處簡直是死路一條。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t如果一切都無效，和朋友們擠在一起分享體溫，或許能救你免於凍死。</size>

##	I had such a wonderful nap, but when I woke up the rest of the troop was gone!\n\n	I'm sure they're just around the corner. They wouldn't be so foolish as to break <color\=red>Rule 0</color> just because I needed a little lie-down!##
